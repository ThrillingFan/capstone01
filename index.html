  <h2><img src="./resources/images/resume.png" alt="work icon" height="50" />Summary</h2>
  <p>I'm Thrilling Fan, a passionate web development learner with a heart for
    creating digital experiences that resonate. When I'm not diving into code, you'll find me lost in a good book or binge-watching the latest gripping
    TV series. The thrill of a well-executed plot or a closely contested football
    match really gets my adrenaline pumping.</p>

  <p>In a previous life, I served as the Vice President of Non-Important
    Affairsâ€”yes, it sounds quirky, but it taught me the importance of teamwork and
    a good sense of humor! My true passions lie with my family, software
    development, and the world of literature, where stories come alive and
    inspire.</p>
